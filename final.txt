Organizational change management: is a framework for managing the effect of new business processes
Software development life cycle:Term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.

Timeboxing: allocates a fixed time period, called a time box, to each planned activity.
Joint Application Development:is a development methodology system originally used for designing a computer-based system, but can be applied to any development process
Package:a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. 
Pattern :can then be used to create a Matcher object that can match arbitrary character sequences against the regular expression

Difference between a class and an object:An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings. This subtle conceptual difference between classes and objects shows why there is a tendency to want to use them interchangeably
